For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle
Then I created atable to insert the Spotify data into
Lastly, I preformed analytics on the data using SQL

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

I then inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table and queried the data

I determined the top 10 songs with the highest energy and listed their energy level and name of the artist
* SELECT artist_name, track_name, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 10

I determined all songs on the list that have a loudness of -4 and sorted them in order of most loud to least loud. I included the artist name, song, and loundness level.
*SELECT artist_name, track_name, loudness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE loudness like '-4.%'
ORDER BY loudness ASC

I determined the number of songs with a popularity greater than or equal to 90. 
*SELECT count(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >=90
