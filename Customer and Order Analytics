In this example of SQL, I am using a database with multiple tables within it to quantify customer and order data.

1. How many orders were placed in January?
* SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
* SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE product="iPhone"

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the oders that were placed in February. 
* SELECT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FEB 
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderID

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
* SELECT DISTINCT Product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
* SELECT product 
SUM(quantity)*price as total_revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101,  how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
* SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price as total_revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101" 
GROUP BY product

7. How many customers orderd more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
*SELECT count(customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity)*price as avg_spent 
FROM FebSales 
LEFT JOIN customers 
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id 
WHERE FebSales.quantity>2

8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
* SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product

9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 
*SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '% New York%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID) >=3

10. How many of each type of headphones were sold in February?
*SELECT product, sum(quantity) as quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product

11. What was the averrage amount apent per account in February? 
*SSELECT SUM(quantity*price)/count(customers.acctnum) as Avg_Amt_Spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_ID

12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
*SELECT SUM(quantity)/count(customers.acctnum) as Avg_Products_Purchased
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id

13. Which product brought in the most revenue in Janury and how much did it bring in total?

ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC
